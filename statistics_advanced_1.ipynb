        "***THEORY QUESTIONS***\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        "ANS=A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to outcomes of a random experiment. It can take different values depending on chance. It connects probabilities to numbers for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "ANS=Random variables are of two types: discrete (finite or countable outcomes) and continuous (uncountable, takes any value in a range). They describe different types of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "ANS=Discrete distributions deal with countable outcomes (e.g., dice rolls). Continuous distributions describe data that can take any value within an interval (e.g., height).\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "ANS=For discrete variables, PDF gives the probability of each value. For continuous variables, PDF defines the probability density â€” area under the curve represents probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDF?\n",
        "ANS=CDF gives the probability a variable is less than or equal to a value. PDF shows likelihood at a specific value (discrete) or density at a point (continuous).\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "ANS=A discrete uniform distribution assigns equal probability to each of a finite set of outcomes. Example: fair dice rolls (each face has 1/6 chance).\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        "ANS=Bernoulli distribution models a single trial with two outcomes: success (1) or failure (0). The mean is p, variance is p(1-p), where p is success probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used?\n",
        "ANS=Binomial distribution gives the probability of a fixed number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials. Itâ€™s used in quality control, surveys, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "ANS=Poisson distribution models the count of events occurring in a fixed interval of time/space when events happen at a constant rate. Applied in queuing, call arrivals.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "ANS=A continuous uniform distribution has equal probability density across an interval. Example: picking a point randomly on a line segment.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        "ANS=Normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped, defined by mean and variance. Most data lies near the mean; used widely in natural and social sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        "ANS=Itâ€™s a normal distribution with mean 0, std dev 1. It simplifies calculations and allows comparison across different normal datasets using Z-scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical?\n",
        "ANS=CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normal as sample size grows, regardless of population shape. It underpins many statistical methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "ANS=CLT explains why normal distribution appears in sample means and sums, even if data itself is not normal. It justifies use of normal-based inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "ANS=Z statistics assess how far a sample mean is from the population mean (in std dev units). Itâ€™s used in large-sample hypothesis tests for means/proportions.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
        "ANS=Z = (X - Î¼)/Ïƒ. It represents how many standard deviations X is from the mean Î¼. Helps compare values from different distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What are point estimates and interval estimates?\n",
        "ANS=Point estimate gives a single value as an estimate of a parameter (e.g. sample mean). Interval estimate gives a range (confidence interval) likely containing the parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the significance of confidence intervals?\n",
        "ANS=Confidence intervals show the range where a population parameter likely lies with a certain probability (e.g. 95%). They express estimate uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the relationship between Z-score and confidence interval?\n",
        "ANS=Z-scores determine the width of confidence intervals under normal assumptions (e.g. 1.96 Z gives 95% CI). Z connects confidence level to interval bounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "ANS=Z-scores standardize values, allowing comparison across datasets with different means and variances. They show relative position in respective distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What are the assumptions for applying the CLT?\n",
        "ANS=Samples must be independent, identically distributed, and sufficiently large. The population should have a finite variance for the CLT to hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ What is the concept of expected value in probability?\n",
        "ANS=Expected value is the long-run average outcome of a random variable. Itâ€™s the weighted mean of all possible values using their probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ How does a probability distribution relate to expected outcome?\n",
        "ANS=A probability distribution defines the probabilities used to compute expected value. It determines the average result over many trials."
